So I am using Debian9, but i found that my NTFS partitions (sdc2) are mounted as read-only.

Following is the messgae I got.

```
The disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0).
Metadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.
Falling back to read-only mount because the NTFS partition is in an
unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown Windows fully (no hibernation
or fast restarting.)
```

After all, I can correct this problem by using `ntfsfix`

```
dsaint31@dsaint31:/mnt/g_drv$ sudo ntfsfix /dev/sdc2
Mounting volume... The disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0).
Metadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.
